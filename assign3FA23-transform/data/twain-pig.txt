The-way Notorious-way Jumping-way Frog-way of-way Calaveras-way County-way

In-way compliance-way with-way the-way request-way of-way a-way friend-way of-way mine,-way who-way wrote-way me-way
from-way the-way East,-way I-way called-way on-way good-natured,-way garrulous-way old-way Simon-way Wheeler,-way
and-way inquired-way after-way my-way friend's-way friend,-way Leonidas-way W.-way Smiley,-way as-way requested-way
to-way do,-way and-way I-way hereunto-way append-way the-way result.-way I-way have-way a-way lurking-way suspicion-way
that-way Leonidas-way W.-way Smiley-way is-way a-way myth;-way that-way my-way friend-way never-way knew-way
such-way a-way personage;-way and-way that-way he-way only-way conjectured-way that-way if-way I-way asked-way
old-way Wheeler-way about-way him,-way it-way would-way remind-way him-way of-way his-way infamous-way Jim-way
Smiley,-way and-way he-way would-way go-way to-way work-way and-way bore-way me-way to-way death-way with-way some-way
exasperating-way reminiscence-way of-way him-way as-way long-way and-way as-way tedious-way as-way it-way should-way
be-way useless-way to-way me.-way If-way that-way was-way the-way design,-way it-way succeeded.-way

I-way found-way Simon-way Wheeler-way dozing-way comfortably-way by-way the-way bar-room-way stove-way
of-way the-way dilapidated-way tavern-way in-way the-way decayed-way mining-way camp-way of-way Angel's,-way
and-way I-way noticed-way that-way he-way was-way fat-way and-way bald-headed,-way and-way had-way an-way expression-way
of-way winning-way gentleness-way and-way simplicity-way upon-way his-way tranquil-way countenance.-way
He-way roused-way up,-way and-way gave-way me-way good-day.-way I-way told-way him-way a-way friend-way of-way mine-way
had-way commissioned-way me-way to-way make-way some-way inquiries-way about-way a-way cherished-way companion-way
of-way his-way boyhood-way named-way Leonidas-way W.-way Smiley--Rev.-way Leonidas-way W.-way Smiley,-way
a-way young-way minister-way of-way the-way Gospel,-way who-way he-way had-way heard-way was-way at-way one-way time-way
a-way resident-way of-way Angel's-way Camp.-way I-way added-way that-way if-way Mr.-way Wheeler-way could-way tell-way
me-way anything-way about-way this-way Rev.-way Leonidas-way W.-way Smiley,-way I-way would-way feel-way under-way
many-way obligations-way to-way him.-way

Simon-way Wheeler-way backed-way me-way into-way a-way corner-way and-way blockaded-way me-way there-way with-way
his-way chair,-way and-way then-way sat-way down-way and-way reeled-way off-way the-way monotonous-way narrative-way
which-way follows-way this-way paragraph.-way He-way never-way smiled,-way he-way never-way frowned,-way
he-way never-way changed-way his-way voice-way from-way the-way gentle-flowing-way key-way to-way which-way
he-way tuned-way his-way initial-way sentence,-way he-way never-way betrayed-way the-way slightest-way
suspicion-way of-way enthusiasm;-way but-way all-way through-way the-way interminable-way narrative-way
there-way ran-way a-way vein-way of-way impressive-way earnestness-way and-way sincerity,-way which-way
showed-way me-way plainly-way that,-way so-way far-way from-way his-way imagining-way that-way there-way was-way
anything-way ridiculous-way or-way funny-way about-way his-way story,-way he-way regarded-way it-way as-way
a-way really-way important-way matter,-way and-way admired-way its-way two-way heroes-way as-way men-way of-way
transcendent-way genius-way in-way finesse.-way I-way let-way him-way go-way on-way in-way his-way own-way way,-way
and-way never-way interrrupted-way him-way once.-way

``Rev.-way Leonidas-way W.-way H'm,-way Reverend-way Le--well,-way there-way was-way a-way feller-way here-way
once-way by-way the-way name-way of-way Jim-way Smiley,-way in-way the-way winter-way of-way '49--or-way may-way
be-way it-way was-way the-way spring-way of-way '50--I-way don't-way recollect-way exactly,-way somehow,-way
though-way what-way makes-way me-way think-way it-way was-way one-way or-way the-way other-way is-way because-way I-way
remember-way the-way big-way flume-way warn't-way finished-way when-way he-way first-way come-way to-way the-way
camp;-way but-way any-way way,-way he-way was-way the-way curiosest-way man-way about-way always-way betting-way
on-way anything-way that-way turned-way up-way you-way ever-way see,-way if-way he-way could-way get-way anybody-way
to-way bet-way on-way the-way other-way side;-way and-way if-way he-way couldn't-way he'd-way change-way sides.-way
Any-way way-way that-way suited-way the-way other-way man-way would-way suit-way him--any-way way-way just-way
so's-way he-way got-way a-way bet,-way he-way was-way satisfied.-way But-way still-way he-way was-way lucky,-way
uncommon-way lucky;-way he-way most-way always-way come-way out-way winner.-way He-way was-way always-way ready-way
and-way laying-way for-way a-way chance;-way there-way couldn't-way be-way no-way solit'ry-way thing-way mentioned-way
but-way that-way feller'd-way offer-way to-way bet-way on-way it,-way and-way take-way ary-way side-way you-way please,-way
as-way I-way was-way just-way telling-way you.-way If-way there-way was-way a-way horse-race,-way you'd-way find-way
him-way flush-way or-way you'd-way find-way him-way busted-way at-way the-way end-way of-way it;-way if-way there-way was-way
a-way dog-fight,-way he'd-way bet-way on-way it;-way if-way there-way was-way a-way cat-fight,-way he'd-way bet-way
on-way it;-way if-way there-way was-way a-way chicken-fight,-way he'd-way bet-way on-way it;-way why,-way if-way there-way
was-way two-way birds-way setting-way on-way a-way fence,-way he-way would-way bet-way you-way which-way one-way would-way
fly-way first;-way or-way if-way there-way was-way a-way camp-meeting,-way he-way would-way be-way there-way reg'lar-way
to-way bet-way on-way Parson-way Walker,-way which-way he-way judged-way to-way be-way the-way best-way exhorter-way
about-way here,-way and-way so-way he-way was-way too,-way and-way a-way good-way man.-way If-way he-way even-way see-way a-way
straddle-bug-way start-way to-way go-way anywheres,-way he-way would-way bet-way you-way how-way long-way it-way
would-way take-way him-way to-way get-way to--to-way wherever-way he-way was-way going-way to,-way and-way if-way you-way
took-way him-way up,-way he-way would-way foller-way that-way straddle-bug-way to-way Mexico-way but-way what-way
he-way would-way find-way out-way where-way he-way was-way bound-way for-way and-way how-way long-way he-way was-way on-way
the-way road.-way Lots-way of-way the-way boys-way here-way has-way seen-way that-way Smiley,-way and-way can-way tell-way
you-way about-way him.-way Why,-way it-way never-way made-way no-way difference-way to-way him--he'd-way
bet-way on-way any-way thing--the-way dangdest-way feller.-way Parson-way Walker's-way wife-way
laid-way very-way sick-way once,-way for-way a-way good-way while,-way and-way it-way seemed-way as-way if-way they-way
warn't-way going-way to-way save-way her;-way but-way one-way morning-way he-way come-way in,-way and-way Smiley-way
up-way and-way asked-way him-way how-way she-way was,-way and-way he-way said-way she-way was-way considable-way better--thank-way
the-way Lord-way for-way his-way inf'nit-way mercy--and-way coming-way on-way so-way smart-way that-way with-way
the-way blessing-way of-way Prov'dence-way she'd-way get-way well-way yet;-way and-way Smiley,-way before-way
he-way thought-way says,-way ``Well,-way I'll-way resk-way two-and-a-half-way she-way don't-way anyway.''-way

Thish-yer-way Smiley-way had-way a-way mare--the-way boys-way called-way her-way the-way fifteen-minute-way
nag,-way but-way that-way was-way only-way in-way fun,-way you-way know,-way because-way of-way course-way she-way
was-way faster-way than-way that--and-way he-way used-way to-way win-way money-way on-way that-way horse,-way for-way
all-way she-way was-way so-way slow-way and-way always-way had-way the-way asthma,-way or-way the-way distemper,-way
or-way the-way consumption,-way or-way something-way of-way that-way kind.-way They-way used-way to-way give-way
her-way two-way or-way three-way hundred-way yards'-way start,-way and-way then-way pass-way her-way under-way
way;-way but-way always-way at-way the-way fag-end-way of-way the-way race-way she'd-way get-way excited-way and-way
desperate-like,-way and-way come-way cavorting-way and-way straddling-way up,-way and-way scattering-way
her-way legs-way around-way limber,-way sometimes-way in-way the-way air,-way and-way sometimes-way out-way
to-way one-way side-way amongst-way the-way fences,-way and-way kicking-way up-way m-o-r-e-way dust-way and-way
raising-way m-o-r-e-way racket-way with-way her-way coughing-way and-way sneezing-way and-way blowing-way
her-way nose--and-way always-way fetch-way up-way at-way the-way stand-way just-way about-way a-way neck-way
ahead,-way as-way near-way as-way you-way could-way cipher-way it-way down.-way

And-way he-way had-way a-way little-way small-way bull-pup,-way that-way to-way look-way at-way him-way you'd-way think-way
he-way warn't-way worth-way a-way cent-way but-way to-way set-way around-way and-way look-way ornery-way and-way lay-way
for-way a-way chance-way to-way steal-way something.-way But-way as-way soon-way as-way money-way was-way up-way on-way
him-way he-way was-way a-way different-way dog;-way his-way under-jaw'd-way begin-way to-way stick-way out-way
like-way the-way fo'castle-way of-way a-way steamboat,-way and-way his-way teeth-way would-way uncover-way
and-way shine-way like-way the-way furnaces.-way And-way a-way dog-way might-way tackle-way him-way and-way bully-rag-way
him,-way and-way bite-way him,-way and-way throw-way him-way over-way his-way shoulder-way two-way or-way three-way
times,-way and-way Andrew-way Jackson--which-way was-way the-way name-way of-way the-way pup--Andrew-way
Jackson-way would-way never-way let-way on-way but-way what-way he-way was-way satisfied,-way and-way hadn't-way
expected-way nothing-way else--and-way the-way bets-way being-way doubled-way and-way doubled-way on-way
the-way other-way side-way all-way the-way time,-way till-way the-way money-way was-way all-way up;-way and-way then-way
all-way of-way a-way sudden-way he-way would-way grab-way that-way other-way dog-way just-way by-way the-way j'int-way
of-way his-way hind-way leg-way and-way freeze-way to-way it--not-way chaw,-way you-way understand,-way but-way
only-way just-way grip-way and-way hang-way on-way till-way they-way throwed-way up-way the-way sponge,-way if-way it-way
was-way a-way year.-way Smiley-way always-way come-way out-way winner-way on-way that-way pup,-way till-way he-way
harnessed-way a-way dog-way once-way that-way didn't-way have-way no-way hind-way legs,-way because-way they'd-way
been-way sawed-way off-way in-way a-way circular-way saw,-way and-way when-way the-way thing-way had-way gone-way along-way
far-way enough,-way and-way the-way money-way was-way all-way up,-way and-way he-way come-way to-way make-way a-way snatch-way
for-way his-way pet-way holt,-way he-way see-way in-way a-way minute-way how-way he's-way been-way imposed-way on,-way
and-way how-way the-way other-way dog-way had-way him-way in-way the-way door,-way so-way to-way speak,-way and-way he-way 'peared-way
surprised,-way and-way then-way he-way looked-way sorter-way discouraged-like,-way and-way didn't-way
try-way no-way more-way to-way win-way the-way fight,-way and-way so-way he-way got-way shucked-way out-way bad.-way He-way
give-way Smiley-way a-way look,-way as-way much-way as-way to-way say-way his-way heart-way was-way broke,-way and-way
it-way was-way his-way fault,-way for-way putting-way up-way a-way dog-way that-way hadn't-way no-way hind-way legs-way
for-way him-way to-way take-way holt-way of,-way which-way was-way his-way main-way dependence-way in-way a-way fight,-way
and-way then-way he-way limped-way off-way a-way piece-way and-way laid-way down-way and-way died.-way It-way was-way a-way
good-way pup,-way was-way that-way Andrew-way Jackson,-way and-way would-way have-way made-way a-way name-way for-way
hisself-way if-way he'd-way lived,-way for-way the-way stuff-way was-way in-way him-way and-way he-way had-way genius--I-way
know-way it,-way because-way he-way hadn't-way no-way opportunities-way to-way speak-way of,-way and-way it-way
don't-way stand-way to-way reason-way that-way a-way dog-way could-way make-way such-way a-way fight-way as-way he-way
could-way under-way them-way circumstances-way if-way he-way hadn't-way no-way talent.-way It-way always-way
makes-way me-way feel-way sorry-way when-way I-way think-way of-way that-way last-way fight-way of-way his'n,-way and-way
the-way way-way it-way turned-way out.-way

Well,-way thish-yer-way Smiley-way had-way rat-tarriers,-way and-way chicken-way cocks,-way and-way
tomcats-way and-way all-way them-way kind-way of-way things,-way till-way you-way couldn't-way rest,-way and-way
you-way couldn't-way fetch-way nothing-way for-way him-way to-way bet-way on-way but-way he'd-way match-way you.-way
He-way ketched-way a-way frog-way one-way day,-way and-way took-way him-way home,-way and-way said-way he-way cal'lated-way
to-way educate-way him;-way and-way so-way he-way never-way done-way nothing-way for-way three-way months-way but-way
set-way in-way his-way back-way yard-way and-way learn-way that-way frog-way to-way jump.-way And-way you-way bet-way you-way
he-way did-way learn-way him,-way too.-way He'd-way give-way him-way a-way little-way punch-way behind,-way and-way
the-way next-way minute-way you'd-way see-way that-way frog-way whirling-way in-way the-way air-way like-way a-way
doughnut--see-way him-way turn-way one-way summerset,-way or-way may-way be-way a-way couple,-way if-way he-way
got-way a-way good-way start,-way and-way come-way down-way flat-footed-way and-way all-way right,-way like-way
a-way cat.-way He-way got-way him-way up-way so-way in-way the-way matter-way of-way ketching-way flies,-way and-way kep'-way
him-way in-way practice-way so-way constant,-way that-way he'd-way nail-way a-way fly-way every-way time-way as-way
fur-way as-way he-way could-way see-way him.-way Smiley-way said-way all-way a-way frog-way wanted-way was-way education,-way
and-way he-way could-way do-way 'most-way anything--and-way I-way believe-way him.-way Why,-way I've-way seen-way
him-way set-way Dan'l-way Webster-way down-way here-way on-way this-way floor--Dan'l-way Webster-way was-way
the-way name-way of-way the-way frog--and-way sing-way out,-way ``Flies,-way Dan'l,-way flies!''-way and-way
quicker'n-way you-way could-way wink-way he'd-way spring-way straight-way up-way and-way snake-way a-way fly-way
off'n-way the-way counter-way there,-way and-way flop-way down-way on-way the-way floor-way ag'in-way as-way solid-way
as-way a-way gob-way of-way mud,-way and-way fall-way to-way scratching-way the-way side-way of-way his-way head-way with-way
his-way hind-way foot-way as-way indifferent-way as-way if-way he-way hadn't-way no-way idea-way he'd-way been-way doin'-way
any-way more'n-way any-way frog-way might-way do.-way  never-way see-way a-way frog-way so-way modest-way and-way
straightfor'ard-way as-way he-way was,-way for-way all-way he-way was-way so-way gifted.-way And-way when-way it-way
come-way to-way fair-way and-way square-way jumping-way on-way a-way dead-way level,-way he-way could-way get-way
over-way more-way ground-way at-way one-way straddle-way than-way any-way animal-way of-way his-way breed-way you-way
ever-way see.-way Jumping-way on-way a-way dead-way level-way was-way his-way strong-way suit,-way you-way understand;-way
and-way when-way it-way come-way to-way that,-way Smiley-way would-way ante-way up-way money-way on-way him-way as-way
long-way as-way he-way had-way a-way red.-way Smiley-way was-way monstrous-way proud-way of-way his-way frog,-way and-way
well-way he-way might-way be,-way for-way fellers-way that-way had-way traveled-way and-way been-way everywheres,-way
all-way said-way he-way laid-way over-way any-way frog-way that-way ever-way they-way see.-way

Well,-way Smiley-way kep't-way the-way beast-way in-way a-way little-way lattice-way box,-way and-way he-way used-way
to-way fetch-way him-way down-way town-way sometimes-way and-way lay-way for-way a-way bet.-way One-way day-way a-way feller--a-way
stranger-way in-way the-way camp,-way he-way was--come-way acrost-way him-way with-way his-way box,-way and-way
says:-way

``What-way might-way it-way be-way that-way you've-way got-way in-way the-way box?''-way

And-way Smiley-way says,-way sorter-way indifferent-like,-way ``It-way might-way be-way a-way parrot,-way
or-way it-way might-way be-way a-way canary,-way maybe,-way but-way it-way ain't--it's-way only-way just-way a-way
frog.''-way

And-way the-way feller-way took-way it,-way and-way looked-way at-way it-way careful,-way and-way turned-way it-way
round-way this-way way-way and-way that,-way and-way says,-way ``H'm--so-way 'tis.-way Well,-way what's-way
he-way good-way for?''-way

``Well,''-way Smiley-way says,-way easy-way and-way careless,-way ``he's-way good-way enough-way for-way
one-way thing,-way I-way should-way judge--he-way can-way outjump-way any-way frog-way in-way Calaveras-way
county.''-way

The-way feller-way took-way the-way box-way again,-way and-way took-way another-way long,-way particular-way
look,-way and-way give-way it-way back-way to-way Smiley,-way and-way says,-way very-way deliberate,-way ``Well,''-way
he-way says,-way ``I-way don't-way see-way no-way p'ints-way about-way that-way frog-way that's-way any-way better'n-way
any-way other-way frog.''-way

``Maybe-way you-way don't,''-way Smiley-way says.-way ``Maybe-way you-way understand-way frogs-way
and-way maybe-way you-way don't-way understand-way 'em;-way maybe-way you've-way had-way experience,-way
and-way maybe-way you-way ain't-way only-way a-way amature,-way as-way it-way were.-way Anyways,-way I've-way got-way
my-way opinion-way and-way I'll-way resk-way forty-way dollars-way that-way he-way can-way outjump-way any-way
frog-way in-way Calaveras-way county.''-way

And-way the-way feller-way studied-way a-way minute,-way and-way then-way says,-way kinder-way sad-way like,-way
``Well,-way I'm-way only-way a-way stranger-way here,-way and-way I-way ain't-way got-way no-way frog;-way but-way
if-way I-way had-way a-way frog,-way I'd-way bet-way you.''-way

And-way then-way Smiley-way says,-way ``That's-way all-way right--that's-way all-way right--if-way
you'll-way hold-way my-way box-way a-way minute,-way I'll-way go-way and-way get-way you-way a-way frog.''-way And-way
so-way the-way feller-way took-way the-way box,-way and-way put-way up-way his-way forty-way dollars-way along-way
with-way Smiley's,-way and-way set-way down-way to-way wait.-way

So-way he-way set-way there-way a-way good-way while-way thinking-way and-way thinking-way to-way hisself,-way
and-way then-way he-way got-way the-way frog-way out-way and-way prized-way his-way mouth-way open-way and-way took-way
a-way teaspoon-way and-way filled-way him-way full-way of-way quail-way shot--filled-way him-way pretty-way
near-way up-way to-way his-way chin--and-way set-way him-way on-way the-way floor.-way Smiley-way he-way went-way to-way
the-way swamp-way and-way slopped-way around-way in-way the-way mud-way for-way a-way long-way time,-way and-way finally-way
he-way ketched-way a-way frog,-way and-way fetched-way him-way in,-way and-way give-way him-way to-way this-way feller,-way
and-way says:-way

``Now,-way if-way you're-way ready,-way set-way him-way alongside-way of-way Dan'l,-way with-way his-way forepaws-way
just-way even-way with-way Dan'l's,-way and-way I'll-way give-way the-way word.''-way Then-way he-way says,-way
``One--two--three-git!''-way and-way him-way and-way the-way feller-way touched-way up-way the-way
frogs-way from-way behind,-way and-way the-way new-way frog-way hopped-way off-way lively,-way but-way Dan'l-way
give-way a-way heave,-way and-way hysted-way up-way his-way shoulders--so--like-way a-way Frenchman,-way
but-way it-way warn't-way no-way use--he-way couldn't-way budge;-way he-way was-way planted-way as-way solid-way
as-way a-way church,-way and-way he-way couldn't-way no-way more-way stir-way than-way if-way he-way was-way anchored-way
out.-way Smiley-way was-way a-way good-way deal-way surprised,-way and-way he-way was-way disgusted-way too,-way
but-way he-way didn't-way have-way no-way idea-way what-way the-way matter-way was,-way of-way course.-way

The-way feller-way took-way the-way money-way and-way started-way away;-way and-way when-way he-way was-way going-way
out-way at-way the-way door,-way he-way sorter-way jerked-way his-way thumb-way over-way his-way shoulder--so--at-way
Dan'l,-way and-way says-way again,-way very-way deliberate,-way ``Well,''-way he-way says,-way ``I-way
don't-way see-way no-way p'ints-way about-way that-way frog-way that's-way any-way better'n-way any-way other-way
frog.''-way

Smiley-way he-way stood-way scratching-way his-way head-way and-way looking-way down-way at-way Dan'l-way a-way
long-way time,-way and-way at-way last-way he-way says,-way ``I-way do-way wonder-way what-way in-way the-way nation-way
that-way frog-way throw'd-way off-way for--I-way wonder-way if-way there-way ain't-way something-way the-way
matter-way with-way him--he-way 'pears-way to-way look-way mighty-way baggy,-way somehow.''-way And-way
he-way ketched-way Dan'l-way by-way the-way nap-way of-way the-way neck,-way and-way hefted-way him,-way and-way says,-way
``Why-way blame-way my-way cats-way if-way he-way don't-way weigh-way five-way pound!''-way and-way turned-way him-way
upside-way down-way and-way he-way belched-way out-way a-way double-way handful-way of-way shot.-way And-way then-way
he-way see-way how-way it-way was,-way and-way he-way was-way the-way maddest-way man--he-way set-way the-way frog-way
down-way and-way took-way out-way after-way that-way feller,-way but-way he-way never-way ketched-way him.-way
And----''-way

[Here-way Simon-way Wheeler-way heard-way his-way name-way called-way from-way the-way front-way yard,-way
and-way got-way up-way to-way see-way what-way was-way wanted.]-way And-way turning-way to-way me-way as-way he-way moved-way
away,-way he-way said:-way ``Just-way set-way where-way you-way are,-way stranger,-way and-way rest-way easy--I-way
ain't-way going-way to-way be-way gone-way a-way second.''-way

But,-way by-way your-way leave,-way I-way did-way not-way think-way that-way a-way continuation-way of-way the-way
history-way of-way the-way enterprising-way vagabond-way Jim-way Smiley-way would-way be-way likely-way
to-way afford-way me-way much-way information-way concerning-way the-way Rev.-way Leonidas-way W.-way
Smiley,-way and-way so-way I-way started-way away.-way

At-way the-way door-way I-way met-way the-way sociable-way Wheeler-way returning,-way and-way he-way button-holed-way
me-way and-way recommenced:-way

``Well,-way thish-yer-way Smiley-way had-way a-way yaller-way one-eyed-way cow-way that-way didn't-way
have-way no-way tail,-way only-way jest-way a-way short-way stump-way like-way a-way bannanner,-way and----''-way

However,-way lacking-way both-way time-way and-way inclination,-way I-way did-way not-way wait-way to-way hear-way
about-way the-way afflicted-way cow,-way but-way took-way my-way leave.-way
