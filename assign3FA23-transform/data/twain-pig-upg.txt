wThe wNotorious wJumping wFrog wof wCalaveras wCounty

wIn wcompliance wwith wthe wrequest wof wa wfriend wof wmine, wwho wwrote wme
wfrom wthe wEast, wI wcalled won naturegood wgarrulous wold wSimon wWheeler,
wand winquired wafter wmy wfriend's wfriend, wLeonidas wW. wSmiley, was wrequested
wto wdo, wand wI whereunto wappend wthe wresult. wI whave wa wlurking wsuspicion
wthat wLeonidas wW. wSmiley wis wa wmyth; wthat wmy wfriend wnever wknew
wsuch wa wpersonage; wand wthat whe wonly wconjectured wthat wif wI wasked
wold wWheeler wabout whim, wit wwould wremind whim wof whis winfamous wJim
wSmiley, wand whe wwould wgo wto wwork wand wbore wme wto wdeath wwith wsome
wexasperating wreminiscence wof whim was wlong wand was wtedious was wit wshould
wbe wuseless wto wme. wIf wthat wwas wthe wdesign, wit wsucceeded.

wI wfound wSimon wWheeler wdozing wcomfortably wby wthe robar wstove
wof wthe wdilapidated wtavern win wthe wdecayed wmining wcamp wof wAngel's,
wand wI wnoticed wthat whe wwas wfat wand headebald wand whad wan wexpression
wof wwinning wgentleness wand wsimplicity wupon whis wtranquil wcountenance.
wHe wroused wup, wand wgave wme dagood wI wtold whim wa wfriend wof wmine
whad wcommissioned wme wto wmake wsome winquiries wabout wa wcherished wcompanion
wof whis wboyhood wnamed wLeonidas wW. Smiley wLeonidas wW. wSmiley,
wa wyoung wminister wof wthe wGospel, wwho whe whad wheard wwas wat wone wtime
wa wresident wof wAngel's wCamp. wI wadded wthat wif wMr. wWheeler wcould wtell
wme wanything wabout wthis wRev. wLeonidas wW. wSmiley, wI wwould wfeel wunder
wmany wobligations wto whim.

wSimon wWheeler wbacked wme winto wa wcorner wand wblockaded wme wthere wwith
whis wchair, wand wthen wsat wdown wand wreeled woff wthe wmonotonous wnarrative
wwhich wfollows wthis wparagraph. wHe wnever wsmiled, whe wnever wfrowned,
whe wnever wchanged whis wvoice wfrom wthe flowigentle wkey wto wwhich
whe wtuned whis winitial wsentence, whe wnever wbetrayed wthe wslightest
wsuspicion wof wenthusiasm; wbut wall wthrough wthe winterminable wnarrative
wthere wran wa wvein wof wimpressive wearnestness wand wsincerity, wwhich
wshowed wme wplainly wthat, wso wfar wfrom whis wimagining wthat wthere wwas
wanything wridiculous wor wfunny wabout whis wstory, whe wregarded wit was
wa wreally wimportant wmatter, wand wadmired wits wtwo wheroes was wmen wof
wtranscendent wgenius win wfinesse. wI wlet whim wgo won win whis wown wway,
wand wnever winterrrupted whim wonce.

w``Rev. wLeonidas wW. wH'm, wReverend Le wthere wwas wa wfeller where
wonce wby wthe wname wof wJim wSmiley, win wthe wwinter wof '49 wmay
wbe wit wwas wthe wspring wof '50 wdon't wrecollect wexactly, wsomehow,
wthough wwhat wmakes wme wthink wit wwas wone wor wthe wother wis wbecause wI

wAny wway wthat wsuited wthe wother wman wwould wsuit him wway wjust

wand wlaying wfor wa wchance; wthere wcouldn't wbe wno wsolit'ry wthing wmentioned
wbut wthat wfeller'd woffer wto wbet won wit, wand wtake wary wside wyou wplease,

wyou wabout whim. wWhy, wit wnever wmade wno wdifference wto him
wbet won wany thing wdangdest wfeller. wParson wWalker's wwife
wlaid wvery wsick wonce, wfor wa wgood wwhile, wand wit wseemed was wif wthey
wwarn't wgoing wto wsave wher; wbut wone wmorning whe wcome win, wand wSmiley
wup wand wasked whim whow wshe wwas, wand whe wsaid wshe wwas wconsidable better
wthe wLord wfor whis winf'nit mercy wcoming won wso wsmart wthat wwith
wthe wblessing wof wProv'dence wshe'd wget wwell wyet; wand wSmiley, wbefore
whe wthought wsays, w``Well, wI'll wresk atwo wshe wdon't wanyway.''

yThish wSmiley whad wa mare wboys wcalled wher wthe minufifteen
wnag, wbut wthat wwas wonly win wfun, wyou wknow, wbecause wof wcourse wshe
wwas wfaster wthan that whe wused wto wwin wmoney won wthat whorse, wfor
wall wshe wwas wso wslow wand walways whad wthe wasthma, wor wthe wdistemper,
wor wthe wconsumption, wor wsomething wof wthat wkind. wThey wused wto wgive
wher wtwo wor wthree whundred wyards' wstart, wand wthen wpass wher wunder

likdesperate wand wcome wcavorting wand wstraddling wup, wand wscattering
wher wlegs waround wlimber, wsometimes win wthe wair, wand wsometimes wout

wraising m wracket wwith wher wcoughing wand wsneezing wand wblowing
wher nose walways wfetch wup wat wthe wstand wjust wabout wa wneck
wahead, was wnear was wyou wcould wcipher wit wdown.

wAnd whe whad wa wlittle wsmall pubull wthat wto wlook wat whim wyou'd wthink
whe wwarn't wworth wa wcent wbut wto wset waround wand wlook wornery wand wlay
wfor wa wchance wto wsteal wsomething. wBut was wsoon was wmoney wwas wup won
whim whe wwas wa wdifferent wdog; whis jawunder wbegin wto wstick wout
wlike wthe wfo'castle wof wa wsteamboat, wand whis wteeth wwould wuncover
wand wshine wlike wthe wfurnaces. wAnd wa wdog wmight wtackle whim wand rbully
whim, wand wbite whim, wand wthrow whim wover whis wshoulder wtwo wor wthree
wtimes, wand wAndrew Jackson wwas wthe wname wof wthe pup
wJackson wwould wnever wlet won wbut wwhat whe wwas wsatisfied, wand whadn't
wexpected wnothing else wthe wbets wbeing wdoubled wand wdoubled won
wthe wother wside wall wthe wtime, wtill wthe wmoney wwas wall wup; wand wthen
wall wof wa wsudden whe wwould wgrab wthat wother wdog wjust wby wthe wj'int
wof whis whind wleg wand wfreeze wto it wchaw, wyou wunderstand, wbut
wonly wjust wgrip wand whang won wtill wthey wthrowed wup wthe wsponge, wif wit
wwas wa wyear. wSmiley walways wcome wout wwinner won wthat wpup, wtill whe
wharnessed wa wdog wonce wthat wdidn't whave wno whind wlegs, wbecause wthey'd
wbeen wsawed woff win wa wcircular wsaw, wand wwhen wthe wthing whad wgone walong
wfar wenough, wand wthe wmoney wwas wall wup, wand whe wcome wto wmake wa wsnatch
wfor whis wpet wholt, whe wsee win wa wminute whow whe's wbeen wimposed won,
wand whow wthe wother wdog whad whim win wthe wdoor, wso wto wspeak, wand whe w'peared
wsurprised, wand wthen whe wlooked wsorter likdiscouraged wand wdidn't
wtry wno wmore wto wwin wthe wfight, wand wso whe wgot wshucked wout wbad. wHe
wgive wSmiley wa wlook, was wmuch was wto wsay whis wheart wwas wbroke, wand
wit wwas whis wfault, wfor wputting wup wa wdog wthat whadn't wno whind wlegs
wfor whim wto wtake wholt wof, wwhich wwas whis wmain wdependence win wa wfight,
wand wthen whe wlimped woff wa wpiece wand wlaid wdown wand wdied. wIt wwas wa
wgood wpup, wwas wthat wAndrew wJackson, wand wwould whave wmade wa wname wfor
whisself wif whe'd wlived, wfor wthe wstuff wwas win whim wand whe whad genius
wknow wit, wbecause whe whadn't wno wopportunities wto wspeak wof, wand wit
wdon't wstand wto wreason wthat wa wdog wcould wmake wsuch wa wfight was whe
wcould wunder wthem wcircumstances wif whe whadn't wno wtalent. wIt walways
wmakes wme wfeel wsorry wwhen wI wthink wof wthat wlast wfight wof whis'n, wand
wthe wway wit wturned wout.

wWell, ythish wSmiley whad tarrierrat wand wchicken wcocks, wand
wtomcats wand wall wthem wkind wof wthings, wtill wyou wcouldn't wrest, wand
wyou wcouldn't wfetch wnothing wfor whim wto wbet won wbut whe'd wmatch wyou.
wHe wketched wa wfrog wone wday, wand wtook whim whome, wand wsaid whe wcal'lated
wto weducate whim; wand wso whe wnever wdone wnothing wfor wthree wmonths wbut
wset win whis wback wyard wand wlearn wthat wfrog wto wjump. wAnd wyou wbet wyou
whe wdid wlearn whim, wtoo. wHe'd wgive whim wa wlittle wpunch wbehind, wand
wthe wnext wminute wyou'd wsee wthat wfrog wwhirling win wthe wair wlike wa
doughnut whim wturn wone wsummerset, wor wmay wbe wa wcouple, wif whe
wgot wa wgood wstart, wand wcome wdown footflat wand wall wright, wlike
wa wcat. wHe wgot whim wup wso win wthe wmatter wof wketching wflies, wand wkep'
whim win wpractice wso wconstant, wthat whe'd wnail wa wfly wevery wtime was
wfur was whe wcould wsee whim. wSmiley wsaid wall wa wfrog wwanted wwas weducation,
wand whe wcould wdo w'most anything wI wbelieve whim. wWhy, wI've wseen
whim wset wDan'l wWebster wdown where won wthis floor wWebster wwas
wthe wname wof wthe frog wsing wout, w``Flies, wDan'l, wflies!'' wand
wquicker'n wyou wcould wwink whe'd wspring wstraight wup wand wsnake wa wfly
woff'n wthe wcounter wthere, wand wflop wdown won wthe wfloor wag'in was wsolid
was wa wgob wof wmud, wand wfall wto wscratching wthe wside wof whis whead wwith
whis whind wfoot was windifferent was wif whe whadn't wno widea whe'd wbeen wdoin'
wany wmore'n wany wfrog wmight wdo. wnever wsee wa wfrog wso wmodest wand
wstraightfor'ard was whe wwas, wfor wall whe wwas wso wgifted. wAnd wwhen wit
wcome wto wfair wand wsquare wjumping won wa wdead wlevel, whe wcould wget
wover wmore wground wat wone wstraddle wthan wany wanimal wof whis wbreed wyou
wever wsee. wJumping won wa wdead wlevel wwas whis wstrong wsuit, wyou wunderstand;
wand wwhen wit wcome wto wthat, wSmiley wwould wante wup wmoney won whim was
wlong was whe whad wa wred. wSmiley wwas wmonstrous wproud wof whis wfrog, wand
wwell whe wmight wbe, wfor wfellers wthat whad wtraveled wand wbeen weverywheres,
wall wsaid whe wlaid wover wany wfrog wthat wever wthey wsee.

wWell, wSmiley wkep't wthe wbeast win wa wlittle wlattice wbox, wand whe wused
wto wfetch whim wdown wtown wsometimes wand wlay wfor wa wbet. wOne wday wa feller
wstranger win wthe wcamp, whe was wacrost whim wwith whis wbox, wand
wsays:

w``What wmight wit wbe wthat wyou've wgot win wthe wbox?''

wAnd wSmiley wsays, wsorter likindifferent w``It wmight wbe wa wparrot,
wor wit wmight wbe wa wcanary, wmaybe, wbut wit ain't wonly wjust wa
wfrog.''

wAnd wthe wfeller wtook wit, wand wlooked wat wit wcareful, wand wturned wit
wround wthis wway wand wthat, wand wsays, ``H'm w'tis. wWell, wwhat's
whe wgood wfor?''

w``Well,'' wSmiley wsays, weasy wand wcareless, w``he's wgood wenough wfor
wone wthing, wI wshould judge wcan woutjump wany wfrog win wCalaveras
wcounty.''

wThe wfeller wtook wthe wbox wagain, wand wtook wanother wlong, wparticular
wlook, wand wgive wit wback wto wSmiley, wand wsays, wvery wdeliberate, w``Well,''
whe wsays, w``I wdon't wsee wno wp'ints wabout wthat wfrog wthat's wany wbetter'n
wany wother wfrog.''

w``Maybe wyou wdon't,'' wSmiley wsays. w``Maybe wyou wunderstand wfrogs
wand wmaybe wyou wdon't wunderstand w'em; wmaybe wyou've whad wexperience,
wand wmaybe wyou wain't wonly wa wamature, was wit wwere. wAnyways, wI've wgot
wmy wopinion wand wI'll wresk wforty wdollars wthat whe wcan woutjump wany
wfrog win wCalaveras wcounty.''

wAnd wthe wfeller wstudied wa wminute, wand wthen wsays, wkinder wsad wlike,
w``Well, wI'm wonly wa wstranger where, wand wI wain't wgot wno wfrog; wbut
wif wI whad wa wfrog, wI'd wbet wyou.''

wAnd wthen wSmiley wsays, w``That's wall right wall right
wyou'll whold wmy wbox wa wminute, wI'll wgo wand wget wyou wa wfrog.'' wAnd
wso wthe wfeller wtook wthe wbox, wand wput wup whis wforty wdollars walong
wwith wSmiley's, wand wset wdown wto wwait.

wSo whe wset wthere wa wgood wwhile wthinking wand wthinking wto whisself,
wand wthen whe wgot wthe wfrog wout wand wprized whis wmouth wopen wand wtook
wa wteaspoon wand wfilled whim wfull wof wquail shot whim wpretty
wnear wup wto whis chin wset whim won wthe wfloor. wSmiley whe wwent wto
wthe wswamp wand wslopped waround win wthe wmud wfor wa wlong wtime, wand wfinally
whe wketched wa wfrog, wand wfetched whim win, wand wgive whim wto wthis wfeller,
wand wsays:

w``Now, wif wyou're wready, wset whim walongside wof wDan'l, wwith whis wforepaws
wjust weven wwith wDan'l's, wand wI'll wgive wthe wword.'' wThen whe wsays,
``One wand whim wand wthe wfeller wtouched wup wthe
wfrogs wfrom wbehind, wand wthe wnew wfrog whopped woff wlively, wbut wDan'l
wgive wa wheave, wand whysted wup whis shoulders wa wFrenchman,
wbut wit wwarn't wno use wcouldn't wbudge; whe wwas wplanted was wsolid
was wa wchurch, wand whe wcouldn't wno wmore wstir wthan wif whe wwas wanchored
wout. wSmiley wwas wa wgood wdeal wsurprised, wand whe wwas wdisgusted wtoo,
wbut whe wdidn't whave wno widea wwhat wthe wmatter wwas, wof wcourse.

wThe wfeller wtook wthe wmoney wand wstarted waway; wand wwhen whe wwas wgoing
wout wat wthe wdoor, whe wsorter wjerked whis wthumb wover whis shoulder
wDan'l, wand wsays wagain, wvery wdeliberate, w``Well,'' whe wsays, w``I
wdon't wsee wno wp'ints wabout wthat wfrog wthat's wany wbetter'n wany wother
wfrog.''

wSmiley whe wstood wscratching whis whead wand wlooking wdown wat wDan'l wa
wlong wtime, wand wat wlast whe wsays, w``I wdo wwonder wwhat win wthe wnation
wthat wfrog wthrow'd woff for wwonder wif wthere wain't wsomething wthe
wmatter wwith him w'pears wto wlook wmighty wbaggy, wsomehow.'' wAnd
whe wketched wDan'l wby wthe wnap wof wthe wneck, wand whefted whim, wand wsays,
w``Why wblame wmy wcats wif whe wdon't wweigh wfive wpound!'' wand wturned whim
wupside wdown wand whe wbelched wout wa wdouble whandful wof wshot. wAnd wthen
whe wsee whow wit wwas, wand whe wwas wthe wmaddest man wset wthe wfrog
wdown wand wtook wout wafter wthat wfeller, wbut whe wnever wketched whim.
And

w[Here wSimon wWheeler wheard whis wname wcalled wfrom wthe wfront wyard,
wand wgot wup wto wsee wwhat wwas wwanted.] wAnd wturning wto wme was whe wmoved
waway, whe wsaid: w``Just wset wwhere wyou ware, wstranger, wand wrest easy
wain't wgoing wto wbe wgone wa wsecond.''

wBut, wby wyour wleave, wI wdid wnot wthink wthat wa wcontinuation wof wthe
whistory wof wthe wenterprising wvagabond wJim wSmiley wwould wbe wlikely
wto wafford wme wmuch winformation wconcerning wthe wRev. wLeonidas wW.
wSmiley, wand wso wI wstarted waway.

wAt wthe wdoor wI wmet wthe wsociable wWheeler wreturning, wand whe holbutton
wme wand wrecommenced:

w``Well, ythish wSmiley whad wa wyaller eyone wcow wthat wdidn't
whave wno wtail, wonly wjest wa wshort wstump wlike wa wbannanner, and

wHowever, wlacking wboth wtime wand winclination, wI wdid wnot wwait wto whear
wabout wthe wafflicted wcow, wbut wtook wmy wleave.
